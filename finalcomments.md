# Comments
Your comments were generally descriptive and gave a sense of not just why but why throughout. They tapered off at the end, but that's to be expected given the way in which you were repeatedly receiving input.

# Code Quality
As you noted yourself in your README, you didn't use functions to encapsulate the code and save yourself typing, which is what this category is mostly about. The code that was present ran well and without error, though entering letters caused your program to exit, something that would have been good to handle.

# Ambition
I like the animating ideas behind this project, and I think the idea of talking about specific consequences to climate change is great. It brings an often-esoteric topic down to earth. It would have been good to have a means of interacting with the program beyond just entering numbers, however.
