You did a really great job documenting this code in the way that I asked: there's a great leading comment at the beginning that talks about not just what the program does but why. You also have the basic user input system down, which is great. I'm not sure that this program is yet doing what you want it to do, however: you are establishing those variables, but you're not yet doing anything with them. I think you have a great working idea for this project, but I really think we need to have some conversation in person, during workshop times or in my office, about how you can construct this program and where you're going to draw data from.
